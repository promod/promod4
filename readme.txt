FAQ

Q: What about the hardcore, and support for all gametypes, how do I use them?
A: For a complete list of "promod_modes", see below.

Q: I want to run my own custom Promod-server with skins etc, how?
A: In order to run your own custom Promod-server you'll need to change the fs_game to anything besides "mods/pml220" as well as not using match-modes. You will now be able to modify the Promod IWDs and add additional iwd-files.

Q: Can I use this mod as a movie mod?
A: Yes, you can! Commands (which are important for movie-making) are only forced on the clients once connected. Demos needs to be loaded using devmap before starting a demo ("devmap mp_crash;disconnect").

Q: How do I get the scorebot running?
A: See below how to enable scorebot.

Q: Class related binds, how do they work?
A: See below for a list of commands.

Q: What's the difference between the EU and NE version of Promod?
A: The NE version of Promod has rate and cl_maxpackets settings unlocked and radar does not display enemy indicators while shooting. NE stands for Non-Europe.

Q: My question is not answered here.
A: Easiest way to contact us is via mail or join #codpromod @ QuakeNet.

Q: How do I get the training-dummy to work?
A: First put up a local home-hosted server without PB (set sv_punkbuster to "0" in your config, start game, launch Promod from the mods-menu and load a map with the console or menu). The default button for spawning a bot is the "N" button (bind X "+actionslot 1").

PROMOD MODES

The promod_mode dvar follows a specific syntax. However the game accepts the bits between underscores ( _ ) in any order.

match: standard match mode, may not be used with knockout mode. Round limit = mr#*2
knockout: knockout match mode, may not be used with standard match mode. Score limit = mr#+1
mr#: maxrounds - see above for use. Default is 10. Works only in Search & Destroy and Sabotage.
lan: lan mode - g_antilag 0, PunkBuster messages turned off, may not be used with pb mode.
hc: hardcore mode (disables some HUD elements and reduces health level to 30).
knife: knife round - adds a knife round and an extra ready-up mode to Search & Destroy matches.
1v1/2v2: used for 1v1 and 2v2 matches, disables Demolitions and Sniper classes.
pb: disables PunkBuster warnings for online modes, may not be used with lan mode.
#:#: will set match score in S&D using A:D format - useful in case of a restart, may not be used with knife mode.

For example "promod_mode match_mr10_knife_pb" will enable knife round and disable PunkBuster warnings in standard maxrounds 10 mode.

There are also some other modes, these can not be combined with the tags above.

comp_public - the default mode for competitive public
comp_public_lan - same as above, but for LAN servers
comp_public_hc - competitive public in hardcore mode
comp_public_hc_lan - same as above, but for LAN servers
custom_public - custom public mode reading settings from z_c_r.iwd
custom_public_lan - same as above, but for LAN servers
strat - strategy mode for practicing

FORCED COMMANDS

All these dvars are forced by Promod (automatically), make sure they stay untouched/within range to avoid being punished!
Note that these does not apply in Shoutcaster mode.

DEMO VIEWING

There are some special dvars made to control hud-elements for demo/movie purposes.
They will only work in maps loaded with cheats (devmap). Don't forget the "set" prefix to add new dvars in the console.

These include:

promod_movie_hidescorebar // [0-1] (hides the mini-scorebar completely including timer)
promod_centermessage_position // [x+-] (overrides default Y-position of the "You killed..." text)

CLASS BINDS

It is possible to bind these via the in-game menu (Controls - Multiplayer Controls...).
Alternatively you can manually bind them in the console/config.

bind [KEY] [COMMAND]

Commands:

openscriptmenu quickpromod assault
openscriptmenu quickpromod specops
openscriptmenu quickpromod demolitions
openscriptmenu quickpromod sniper
openscriptmenu quickpromod silencer
openscriptmenu quickpromod grenade

SHOUTCASTER BINDS

You can bind them via the in-game menu (Shoutcast Setup).
Alternatively you can manually bind them in the console/config.

bind [KEY] [COMMAND]

Commands:

openscriptmenu shoutcast_setup number
openscriptmenu shoutcast_setup assault
openscriptmenu shoutcast_setup specops
openscriptmenu shoutcast_setup demolitions
openscriptmenu shoutcast_setup sniper

Number being 1-10 for players, it's very easy to understand which player corresponds the correct number.
1-5 symbolizes players on Attacking side from top to bottom looking at the Shoutcaster-bars.
6-10 being on the Defending side.

Setting a class (lowercase) instead of a number will cycle through players using that class.

CUSTOM MAPS

In case Promod is throwing an error while playing on custom maps, make sure the IWD-files inside "usermaps/mapname" folder have the same map name in them.
For example map "mp_dahman_b3" contains a file called "mp_dahman_b3.iwd" and therefore it is not marked as a violation.

NOTES FOR SERVER-ADMINS AND SERVER-HOSTING COMPANIES

The dvar fs_game "mods/pml220" is forced for match-servers and do not rename any files or modify contents of them.
However custom servers with skins etc. must use something else than "mods/pml220" for example "mods/pml220_custom", it's not restricted and you are free to add additional iwd files or modify existing ones.

Included with Promod are two PunkBuster MD5 configs, "stock_iwd_md5.cfg" and "promod_iwd_md5.cfg" which you can put in the pb-folder on your server, it contains checksums for the stock IWD-files as well as Promod-IWD for use with PunkBuster MD5 facility to prevent custom skins and other forms of cheating and abusing and can be loaded in-game by typing "\rcon pb_sv_load stock_iwd_md5.cfg" and "\rcon pb_sv_load promod_iwd_md5.cfg".

In order to be automatically-executed, the list of checks needs to be included into the automatically-executed PunkBuster configuration files on your server (pbsv.cfg or pbsvuser.cfg):

pb_sv_load stock_iwd_md5.cfg
pb_sv_load promod_iwd_md5.cfg // match-server only

In case your server doesn't have any pbsv.cfg file, go in-game and type: "\rcon pb_sv_writecfg". Depending on if your server is streaming to any third-party anti-cheat site(s) you may or may not already have a pbsvuser.cfg, if you don't you can just copy all three files included to your server's PB-folder, or if the file exist add above lines to it.

We STRONGLY encourage use of these MD5-checks! (This goes for leagues as well!)

Due to several game engine exploits, we recommend to specify the rcon-password in the command-line of your server. If this is not possible, rename the server-config to something other than server.cfg, which would make finding rcon password more difficult.

On another note of security, the IWD-file "z_c_r.iwd" is now running integrity checks if server is running match-mode which means you have to decide whether the server should run "promod_mode custom_public" or not.
If you later want to run match-modes you will have to use the original unmodified "z_c_r.iwd" supplied in this package. Sorry for any inconvenience caused.
